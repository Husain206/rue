# Rue

my new little langauge, named rue :D
Rue is a small, C/JS-like programming language implemented in C++. 
Rue is a learning project so far, it doesnt follow the best practies or whatever, i tried to make the code structure as simple and understandable as possiable and reflecting the programming style i like

it is desgined in C++ with a C-like Style while benefeting from the STL c++ provides
i tried not to use OOP as much as possiable becasue OOP sucks, i think i only used once or twice? idr

**fun fact:** rue means "regret" but it also refers to a medical herb which :D
